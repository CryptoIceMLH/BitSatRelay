# Nostr-QO100 Satellite Bridge Project

This R&D project uses QO-100 amateur satellite as a development testbed to validate Bitcoin and Nostr satellite bridge concepts. The goal is to create complementary infrastructure to Blockstream's satellite services, providing network diversity and resilience for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Project Mission

Building a satellite communication bridge that supports **Bitcoin** and **Nostr** protocols, designed as a complementary service to **Blockstream's satellite node infrastructure**. This creates redundant, censorship-resistant communication channels for the Bitcoin ecosystem via multiple satellite providers and protocols.

UPDATE: with first working release 5/9/2025


## Overview

I'm building a bridge system that connects **Nostr** (a decentralized social protocol) with satellite communications for off-grid messaging. Currently using the **QO-100 amateur radio satellite** as a proof-of-concept testbed to validate the technical approach and demonstrate feasibility.

**Current Development Strategy**: QO-100 serves as our R&D platform due to its free access and established amateur radio community. Once the concept proves viable and funding is secured, the goal is to scale to **commercial satellite providers** with dedicated bandwidth, creating an alternative and complement to existing Bitcoin satellite services like Blockstream's infrastructure.

## Project Goals

### **Phase 1: Proof of Concept** *(Using QO-100 Amateur Satellite)*
- **Technical Validation**: Prove Nostr â†” satellite bridge concept works
- **Protocol Development**: Establish reliable message routing for Bitcoin/Nostr data
- **Community Testing**: Leverage amateur radio community for feedback and iteration
- **Cost-Free R&D**: Utilize free amateur satellite access for development
- **Blockstream Complement**: Develop alternative to/backup for Blockstream satellite service

### **Phase 2: Commercial Deployment** *(Target: Commercial Satellites)*
- **Dedicated Bandwidth**: Rent transponder time from commercial satellite operators
- **Bitcoin Infrastructure**: Support Bitcoin node sync, Lightning Network, and Nostr relays
- **Global Coverage**: Multiple satellites for worldwide 24/7 Bitcoin/Nostr access
